## 🔍 Problem Statement
Traditional online education platforms follow a one-size-fits-all learning approach, making it difficult to address individual student learning needs. Teachers often identify weak students only after examinations, which limits timely academic intervention. Additionally, online learning environments lack effective mechanisms to monitor and improve student engagement, resulting in reduced learning effectiveness. These challenges primarily affect students and educators by lowering learning outcomes and increasing academic difficulties.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
MindSpark is an AI-powered EdTech prototype designed to support personalized learning, early identification of weak students, and engagement monitoring. The system begins with a diagnostic quiz that assesses a student’s understanding and classifies them into learning levels such as Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced. Based on this classification, the system provides AI-generated learning content and practice questions. It also tracks student activity, quiz performance, and engagement metrics to identify at-risk students early and provide actionable insights to teachers through a simple dashboard. The solution uses rule-based intelligent logic and AI-generated feedback to demonstrate core functionality as a working prototype.
